	abstract = {As part of the Europeana Cloud ({eCloud}) project, Trinity College Dublin investigated best practice in the use of web services, such as {APIs}, for accessing large data sets from cultural heritage collections. This research looked into the provision and use of {APIs}, and moreover, whether or not more customised programmatic access to datasets is what researchers want or need. In order to understand whether current patterns of {API} usage reflect a skills gap on the part of researchers or a mismatch of tool to purpose, we looked not only at the creators and developer/users of {APIs}, but also at humanists already re-using big data; approaches in cultural heritage institutions and other research infrastructures to bring {API} use to non-technical audiences; and the kinds of training and other support services available or emerging within the data-intensive humanities research lifecycle. We conducted both desk research and a series of 11 interviews with figures working as researchers, developers or data providers, including figures from both the {API} development and the data usage communities. This research, conducted under the {eCloud} project and supported by the European Commission’s {ICT} Policy and Support Programme (Grant number 325091), was begun in March 2014 and is now in its concluding validation stage. The results of the research are not yet finalised, but the contribution is already emerging of this work to the debate about {APIs} being either the way forward for digital cultural heritage collections, or the Emperor’s New Clothes (or maybe a bit of both).},

	abstract = {"Data and its technologies now play a large and growing role in humanities research and teaching. This book addresses the needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data modeling in a digital humanities context"--},
